# 🛒 Retail Campaign Impact Analysis

This project evaluates the effectiveness of a marketing campaign rolled out in selected trial stores by comparing their weekly sales performance against matched control stores that did not receive the campaign. The analysis uses Python for data preprocessing, visualization, and insight generation.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Identify appropriate control stores for each trial store
- Compare total sales and product quantity sold across trial and control groups
- Assess the performance of each trial store during and after the campaign
- Provide actionable business recommendations based on the results

---

## 🧪 Methods Used

- Data Cleaning & Transformation (Pandas)
- Time Series Aggregation by Week
- Matched Control Store Selection (based on similarity in sales & customer profiles)
- Comparative Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Impact Analysis (Pre, During, and Post-trial comparison)

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Store 77:** Moderate uplift with post-trial gains
- **Store 88:** Strong, consistent increase in weekly sales during and after the trial
- **Store 86:** Minor impact; performance was close to control throughout
